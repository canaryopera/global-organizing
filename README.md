# Canary Opera Global Organizing

Repository to track global organizing as well as to suggest new project teams.

## Monthly Meeting

The Global team meets every second Wednesday of the month. To make the meeting time more globally inclusive the meeting changes between two times. For every even months (Febuary, April, etc) the meeting is at 18:00 CT. Every odd month (January, March, etc.) the meeting is at 12:00 PM CT.

To attend, in the [PyLadies Slack](https://slackin.pyladies.com/) please `@admin` with your request to join and a PyLadies Slack admin can help.

_Monthly Agenda_

Each month an issue will be opened, using the monthly meeting issue template. We'll use this template to track discussion items, assign priorities, and add to our project board.

## Project Proposals
